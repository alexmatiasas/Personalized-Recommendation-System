with content-based filtering to generate more accurate and diverse recommendations.

Planned Features:
- Hybrid scoring mechanism combining similarity scores and user preferences.
- Integration with TMDb metadata (genres, popularity, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics comparison between pure and hybrid models.

Status: Not implemented yet.
